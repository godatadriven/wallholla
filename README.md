# Wallholla

> a playground for deep learning experiments

## Until we have a proper setup.py

Run the following command in the root folder before using `py.test` or the command line app.

```
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`
```

## Run tests

In the root folder run:

```bash
py.test test
```

## Usage command line app

```
python cl.py runs/example_run/run.yml
```

## Why the name

Wallholla is a very large and [renown](https://www.dutchdesignawards.nl/en/gallery/habitat/the-wall-holla/) playground for children. We now have one for children in the Netherlands, we now also have one for children in the deep learning community.
